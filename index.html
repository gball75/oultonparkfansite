                <p class="centretext">I wanted to create a small fansite based around Oulton Park because I have visited this circuit many times and I absolutely love the place. Since my first visit in 2016 I fell in love with this racing circuit, everything from the beautiful wooded location to the smell of high octain fuel as you drive into the circuit. Every time I visit it feels like I am home! I hope you enjoy the website.
